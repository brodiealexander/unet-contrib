    "## AUV-to-transponder range estimation application using UnetStack\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common practice to attach a transponder to various underwater assets (both static and mobile) for short and long term field deployments. These transponders can act as a beacon that can be utilized for localization. An underwater vehicle (e.g. AUV, ROV) will be able to do sequential ranging to find the location of the transponder during a search and rescue operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, specialized transmitters are required to send a signal to these transponders to trigger a response. However, due to the software defined nature of Subnero modems, it is fairly easy to develop an application that will query a transponder and calculate the range information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we showcase a fully functional transponder ranging application used to ping an [Applied Acoustics 219A](https://www.ashtead-technology.com/rental-equipment/aa-219-micro-beacon/) transponder and calculate the range to it from the recorded signal. This work has been presented in [_M. Chitre, R. Bhatnagar, M. Ignatius, and S. Suman, “Baseband signal processing with UnetStack,” in Underwater Communications Networking (UComms 2014), (Sestri Levante, Italy), September 2014. (Invited)_](http://arl.nus.edu.sg/twiki6/pub/ARL/BibEntries/sdmodem.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "An Applied Acoustics 219A transponder is set to receive a 22 kHz tonal. We send a 5 ms long 22 kHz pulse without preamble (preambleID set to 0) using a `TxBasebandSignalReq` from UnetStack's _Baseband_ service. This will trigger a response at 30 kHz after a fixed delay of 30 ms. We also initiate a 500 ms long passband signal recording using the passband streaming API (`phy.pbscnt`) to make sure the modem records long enough to have the response from the pinger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The captured signal is then Hilbert transformed to do envelop detection. We use thresholding to find the start of the received signal. We also retrieves the `txTime` from `txntf`. Using these two timings, we calculate the range to the transponder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is developed using Jupyter Notebook, in Python using the UnetPy framework."
