# README

This readme serves the audience joining the tutorial on "Practical Software-Defined Underwater Networking" during Global OCEANS 2020.

This directory contains the simulation scripts and other resources for you to be able to run the code explained in this tutorial by yourself.

## Download unet simulator

Download the package `unet-3.1.0.zip` and unzip to unveil the `unet-3.1.0` folder containing the simulation scripts.

## Part 3

The `unet-3.1.0/samples/tutorial-network-part3.groovy` is the simulation script used in this session. Follow the instructions in the video to start the simulation and run this script.

## Part 4

The `unet-3.1.0/samples/tutorial-network-part4.groovy` is the simulation script used in this session. Follow the instructions in the video to start the simulation and run this script.

In addition, `sensor.py` is a Python script which simulates a sensor that was used in Part 4.

Also, the code snippets used to create and run the various demos for Part 4 are available [here](code-part4.md)

## Part 5

The `unet-3.1.0/samples/tutorial-network-part5.groovy` is the simulation script used in this session. Follow the instructions in the video to start the simulation and run this script.

In addition, `tutorial2020.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook used in the Part 5 session on Localization.

To run this jupyter notebook, follow the instructions in the video carefully. You may also follow the steps provided here:
- Install unetpy and fjagepy using `pip install unetpy`
- Install arlpy using `pip install arlpy`
- Make sure scipy is installed, if not install scipy using `pip install scipy`
- If you want to run the jupyter notebook as shown in the video, install jupyter by following the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
